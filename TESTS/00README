 DRIVERS FOR STANDARD PROBLEMS
----------------------------------------

Lap
 
 Drivers for testing a few  methods on simple Laplacean matrices.  You
 will also find here a driver for a matrix-free test whereby no matrix
 is passed  but the  matrix vector-product is  done via  function (and
 set-up as a function pointer).

MM 
 
 Drivers for testing a few  routines to compute eigenvalues of general
 sparse (symmetric real) matrices. These matrices are read from a file
 in  the matrix  market  format. Note:  The HB  matrix  format is  not
 supported.

 DRIVERS FOR GENERALIZED PROBLEMS
---------------------------------------- 

Gen_Lap

  Test drivers  are for  testing  a  few methods  on  simple
  (artificial) Laplacean matrix pair (A, B).  
  
Gen_MM
 
 Drivers  for testing  a  few routines  for  computing eigenvalues  of
 general sparse (symmetric real) matrix pair (A, B), where B has to be
 positive definite.  These matrices are read from a file in the matrix
 market format.  Note: The HB matrix format is not supported.

 OTHER 
---------------------------------------- 

Landos
 
 Drivers for  testing Density of  states routines. So far  the Lanczos
 method for DOS is tested.
