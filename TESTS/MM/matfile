First line  is the number  of matrices to  be tested [called  numat in
drivers]. 2nd  line contains  the path  to the  matrix, followed  by a
short name  for the  matrix, the  datatype of  the input  matrix, left
endpoint  of  the  target  interval,  right  endpoint  of  the  target
interval, and  the number of  slices in  which to divide  the interval
This 2nd line is repeated for as many matrices as indicated by numat

Datatype:

MM0 = matrix market with indexing starting at 0 (as in C)

MM1 = matrix market with indexing starting at 1 (as in Fortran)
