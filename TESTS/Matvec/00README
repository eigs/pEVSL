This folder contains the test drivers for parallel matrix-vector product

y = A * x,

where A is a parallel CSR (Parcsr) matrix, and x and y are parallel vectors (Parvec).

test1.c : Laplacian matrix with DEFAULT    row and column partitionings.

test2.c : Laplacian matrix with CUSTOMIZED row and column partitionings, 
          where the row partitioning is the SAME as the column partitioning.

test3.c : Laplacian matrix with CUSTOMIZED row and column partitionings, 
          where the row partitioning is NOT the same as the column partitioning.

test4.c : Rectangular randomized sparse matrix with CUSTOMIZED row and column partitionings.
